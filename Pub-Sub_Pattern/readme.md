# Pub/Sub Pattern

In RabbitMQ, the Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern is implemented using exchanges and queues. Publishers send messages to an exchange, and subscribers bind their queues to that exchange to receive messages.

Here's how it works:

Publishers send messages to an exchange instead of directly to a queue.
An exchange receives messages from publishers and routes them to one or more queues based on the routing key or message attributes.
Subscribers create a queue and bind it to the exchange. The binding specifies the routing key or message attributes that the subscriber is interested in.
The exchange then sends messages to all the bound queues that match the routing key or message attributes specified by the binding.
In the Pub/Sub pattern in RabbitMQ, each subscriber gets its own copy of the message, which means that subscribers can process messages independently of each other. Additionally, subscribers can come and go without affecting the message flow between publishers and the remaining subscribers.

Overall, the Pub/Sub pattern is a powerful way to implement messaging in RabbitMQ, allowing publishers and subscribers to communicate with each other without tight coupling, while also providing high scalability and flexibility.
