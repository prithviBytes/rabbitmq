# Request Reply Pattern

The RabbitMQ request-reply pattern is a messaging pattern that allows a client to send a request message to a server and receive a response message back.

In this pattern, the client sends a request message to a queue that is monitored by the server. The server processes the request and sends a response message back to a queue that is monitored by the client. The client then receives the response message from the queue and processes it.

To enable this pattern, the client and server need to establish a connection to RabbitMQ and declare the appropriate queues. The client needs to include a unique correlation ID in the request message, which the server uses to correlate the response message to the original request.

This pattern is often used in distributed systems to implement remote procedure calls (RPCs) and other types of request-response interactions between components. It provides a reliable and scalable way to handle message exchanges, as well as a way to decouple the client and server implementations from each other.
