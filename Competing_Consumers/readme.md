### Competing Consumers

In a messaging system like RabbitMQ, competing consumers refers to a pattern where multiple consumers or subscribers compete to consume or process messages from a single message queue.

In this pattern, all consumers connected to a queue receive messages, but only one of them can process a message at a time. When a consumer receives a message, it temporarily blocks other consumers from accessing it until it either acknowledges or rejects the message. This ensures that every message is processed at least once, but it also means that some consumers may receive more messages than others, or that some messages may be processed faster than others.

This pattern can be useful in situations where you need to process a high volume of messages or where you want to distribute work among multiple workers. By allowing multiple consumers to access the same queue, you can increase throughput and processing speed, while still ensuring that every message is processed by at least one consumer.
